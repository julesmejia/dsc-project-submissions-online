# Project Submission & Review

This lesson provides instructions for submitting your End of Phase Projects and explains how your projects will be reviewed.

## Submitting your Project

To submit your project in Canvas, you will create and upload PDF versions of three project deliverables. You will also submit URLs to your GitHub repository in a separate assignment.

### Presentation Slides PDF Creation

1. Export your presentation as a PDF from the program in which you created it.
2. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `presentation.pdf`).
3. Place a copy of the PDF in your GitHub repository.

### GitHub Repository PDF Creation

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project repository on GitHub, using your browser (we recommend Google Chrome).
2. Save the webpage as a PDF using the browser's Print functionality ([Google Chrome Save to PDF instructions])
3. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `github.pdf`).

### Jupyter Notebook PDF Creation

1. Open your Notebook in your browser (we recommend Google Chrome).
2. Run the Notebook from start to finish so that your output is visible.
3. Save the page as a PDF using the browser's Print functionality ([Google Chrome Save to PDF instructions])
4. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `notebook.pdf`).

### PDF Submission in Canvas

You will need to submit all three PDF files as a single submission:

1. Click "Submit Assignment" at the top of this page.
2. In the "File Upload" box, click "Choose File" button to upload a single file.
3. Click the "Add Another File" link to upload an additional file.
4. Repeat Step 3 to upload one more file. After this is done, all three files should be uploaded.
5. Hit the blue "Submit Assignment" button.

### URL Submission in Canvas

There is an additional Canvas assignment where you will just enter the URL for your project's GitHub repository. This is listed in the "Phase X Milestones" module in this course as "Phase X Project - GitHub Repository URL."

## Project Review

You have until the end of the week to present your project and submit it for review. You will receive a grade of P (Pass) or NP (No Pass) - you must pass in order to move to the next phase with your cohort. Your teacher will grade your submission and give you feedback, typically early in the week after you submit.

Which review process you receive will depend on whether you passed the code challenge, as described below.

### Passed Code Challenge: Check for Completion

If you passed the code challenge, your teacher will review your project to check that it is complete.Â Your project will pass if you have completed and submitted all project deliverables. Your project will not be graded using the project rubric at the bottom of the project assignment, although you may find it helpful for guiding your project.

### Did Not Pass Code Challenge: Rubric Grading

If you did not pass the code challenge, your teacher will use the rubric at the bottom of the project assignment to grade your submission. You can earn 0, 1, or 2 points on each rubric element. Your project will pass if it earns at least 50% of the points available.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your hard work on this project - you're going to do great! Remember that future employers will also look at your projects when deciding whether to hire you, so having complete, polished projects will help you tremendously not only to pass this assignment, but also to get the job you want after you graduate.

If you have any questions about the project submission or review process, don't hesitate to ask your teacher.
